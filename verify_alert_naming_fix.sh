echo "Problem:"
echo "--------"
echo "Alert images were being saved with the format 'alertoverlay_UUID.jpg' instead of the"
echo "standardized format 'alert_{camera_id}_{timestamp}_{alert_type}.jpg'."
echo ""
echo "Solution:"
echo "---------"
echo "1. Added a monkey patch to cv2.imwrite in alert_logic/app.py to intercept and rename any"
echo "   'alertoverlay_UUID.jpg' files to our standardized format."
echo "2. Added cleanup code at the end of the alert processing to find and rename any missed files."
echo "3. Added a test camera ID 'CAM_TEST' to the database to enable database inserts during testing."
